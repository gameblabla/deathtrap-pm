DEATHTRAP
==============

A small funny game i made for Pokémon Mini in ANSI C,

i got the idea for this game simply because i hated (and still hate)  copyright nazis like Nintendo and Sega of japan.

Makefile probably needs to be updated for your environment.

If you want to play the game, simply download the min file and play it with PokéMini.

Optionally, you can also use it with the ColorMap file deathtrap.minc for colors.

For license stuff, see COPYRIGHT.

If you want it to be covered under another open-source license, you can contact me.

(Can't do public domain though because i'm french)
